1. more conv filter (256,128) instead of (128,64)
2. one more conv layer => (256,128,64)
3. reverse number of conv layer (64,128,256)

Tried importing resnet18 model from pytorch library 
Tried HKU gpu, still valid 
test.py: add accuracy for each labels.

Implement convNet2 which has following architecture
Input (3*44*6)
conv1: filter size:3*3 num filter=128 padding=1
maxpooling (2*2)
conv2: filter size: 3*3 num filter=56 
maxpolling (2*1)
fully connected layer 560=>256>128>10

Complete data collection, each class having around 300 training data
Trained ConvNet2 achieving 80% test accuracy lmao, however, further training has lead to overfitting


applying randomCrop with height<44 and width=6

2/1:
complete convNetFlexible which is flexible with different input dimension

applied randomcrops(30,6) and then resize it back to (44,6), it clearly reduced the problem of overfitting, while the testing accuracy is lowered. 
Might consider enlarge the network
test/train accuracy: 45-50%

30/1:
Investigate how to run RNN model with varied image height

8/2: 


TODO: Investigate OCR model
    1. What is it actually 
    2. How to fit it into our motion data
